## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure database is running and configured in `.env` (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite)
2. Install dependencies: `composer install && npm install`
3. Generate application key: `php artisan key:generate`
4. Run migrations and seeders: `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`

### Setup Commands
```bash
# Complete initial setup
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Or just seed the Super Admin separately
php artisan db:seed --class=SuperAdminSeeder

# Clear caches after changes
php artisan config:clear && php artisan route:clear && php artisan view:clear

# Start development servers
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8001
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 **Important: Authentication Security Updates**

**This project has been updated with enterprise-grade security features:**

### ✅ **New Security Features Added**
- Strong password requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, letters)
- Brute force protection (rate limiting)
- Session fixation prevention
- Comprehensive authentication logging
- Dedicated Super Admin seeder

### 👑 **Super Admin Credentials**
- **Email**: `superadmin@bhms.com`
- **Password**: `BHMS@2025!super#`
- **Dashboard**: `/saas/dashboard`

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Change the Super Admin password immediately after first login!

### Test Users Created
- **Super Admin**: `superadmin@bhms.com` / `BHMS@2025!super#`
- **Hospital Admin**: `admin@example.com` / `password`
- **Doctor**: `doctor@example.com` / `password`
- **Patient**: `patient@example.com` / `password`
- **Hospital**: `Test Hospital`

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Super Admin Access
1. Login as Super Admin at `/login` with credentials above
2. Attempt to access hospital dashboard (should redirect or deny)
3. Verify Super Admin can see all hospitals/users (unscoped)

#### 2. Hospital Admin Dashboard
1. Login as Hospital Admin (`admin@example.com` / `password`)
2. Access `/hospital/dashboard`
3. Verify dashboard shows scoped metrics:
   - User count (3 for hospital: admin, doctor, patient)
   - Patient count (1)
4. Check multi-tenancy: Only hospital data visible

#### 3. Settings Module
1. Access `/hospital/settings` as logged-in hospital user
2. Verify module toggles are displayed
3. Check/uncheck boxes and submit
4. Refresh settings page to confirm updates saved

#### 4. Multi-Tenancy Verification
1. Login as different users and confirm scoped queries
2. Create a new user with hospital_id via Tinker: `php artisan tinker`
   ```php
   App\Models\User::create(['name'=>'Test User','email'=>'test2@example.com','password'=>Hash::make('password'),'hospital_id'=>1]);
   ```
3. Login as Hospital Admin and verify user count increased to 5

#### 5. Role-Based Access
1. Verify logged-in user's roles: `$user->roles` in Tinker
2. Test route protection: Attempt to access dashboard without auth (should redirect to login)

#### 6. Authentication & Session
1. Login and verify session persists
2. Logout and confirm session cleared
3. Test Sanctum API tokens if implementing frontend

### Running Tests
```bash
# Complete fresh installation with all seeders
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Run Super Admin only seeder
php artisan db:seed --class=SuperAdminSeeder

# Run specific seeders individually
php artisan db:seed --class=RoleSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=SubscriptionPlanSeeder

# Testing with Feature Tests (coming soon)
php artisan test --filter=AuthenticationTest

# Tinker for manual testing
php artisan tinker
```

### Expected Results
- ✅ Dashboard displays correct scoped metrics
- ✅ Settings updates persist and toggle modules
- ✅ Multi-tenancy isolates data per hospital
- ✅ Authentication prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ Super Admin bypasses hospital scoping

### Troubleshooting
- If dashboard shows 0 counts, check user hospital_id assignments
- If login fails, verify hashed passwords in seeder
- Clear cache: `php artisan cache:clear` and restart PHP service
